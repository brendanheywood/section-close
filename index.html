<li><a href="attempt1">Attempt 1</a> - A simple naive attempt which scrolls down as the section is rolled up, results in a jittery motion and is probably fairly crap performance on some devices
<li><a href="attempt2">Attempt 2</a> - Animates a stub div open as the section closes, and then does a single scrollTo at the end
